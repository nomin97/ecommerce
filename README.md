# E-commerce Back End

## Description
This application uses object relational mapping to create a e-commerce back end. The starter code had most of the coding and I added some backend and connected them. Mysql was also used to store and retrieve the data. CRUD operations were easy to get the hang of and test in insomnia, although there are some trick parts like when creating a new product is created but not shown to have been a success, so there are multiples of the same data. Association methods were also a little tricky since they're all intertwined by id and foreign key relationships. Overall this assignment helped me better understand ORM and CRUD operations.
